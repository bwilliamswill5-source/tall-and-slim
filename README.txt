Tall & Slim — Demo Affiliate Marketplace
---------------------------------------
Files created:
 - index.html
 - styles.css
 - app.js
 - products.json

How to run locally:
 1. Unzip the package and open index.html in a browser (or use a simple HTTP server:
    python3 -m http.server 8000
    then visit http://localhost:8000)

Next steps to turn this into a production affiliate marketplace:
 - Replace example affiliate links with real affiliate links from networks (Rakuten, CJ, Awin, Impact, or brand affiliate programs).
 - Add server-side redirect/tracking to avoid leaking affiliate params and to record conversions.
 - Integrate analytics and Pixel tracking per affiliate partnership requirements.
 - Add admin UI or CMS to add/manage products and brands (or use Shopify as a backend, with storefront API).
 - Implement user accounts, wishlists, and specialized fit tools (size calculator, measurement guide).
